Source Documentation
====================

Our upstream dependencies:

* Mozilla Firefox
* LibreWolf
* uBlock Origin
* I still don't care about cookies

LibreWolf consists of two parts:

* Settings
* Browser Source

These two combined produce the `yikwid-<version>.source.tar.gz` release tarball.

This tarball contains a `Makefile` that allows you to build and patch the Yikwid Browser sources.
